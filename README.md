# CutSPR
CutSPR is a tool that assists the construction of a mutagenesis vector based on the pJoe8999 plasmid system.

It uses genomic references in the form of GenBank or Fasta formatted sequence files to generate primers for the construction of a specific CRISPR-Cas9 based deletion or insertion vector.


CutSPR is written in Python and requires the following packages:
<ul>
<li>PyQT5</li>
<li>biopython</li>
</ul>

In addition, the NCBI Blast software package needs to be installed for CutSPR to function which can be obtained here:
