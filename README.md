# CutSPR

CutSPR is a tool that assists with the construction of deletion or insertion cassettes using the CRISPR-Cas system. 

It uses genomic references in form of GenBank or Fasta formatted sequence files and generates primers to be used for either deletion or insertion cassettes.


CutSPR is written in Python and requires the following packages:
<ul>
<li>PyQT5</li>
<li>biopython</li>
</ul>

In addition, the NCBI Blast software package needs to be installed for CutSPR to function which can be obtained here:
